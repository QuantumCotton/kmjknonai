KMJK LOGO INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
====================================

Your favicon is ready! Now just copy it to this folder:

1. Take your favicon.ico file (the KMJK logo you created)
2. Copy it to: e:\Projects\websites\ElegantKmjk\kmjknonai\public\
3. Replace the existing favicon.ico file

That's it! Your KMJK logo will now appear in:
✓ Browser tabs
✓ Bookmarks
✓ Browser history
✓ Mobile home screen icons

The HTML is already configured to use:
- favicon.ico (for older browsers)
- kmjk-logo.png (for high-res modern browsers)

Both files should be placed in the public/ folder.
