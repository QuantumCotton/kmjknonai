ADAPTIVE INTAKE FOR GROWTH CANVAS:
Based on their service type, intelligently gather:

- Service area/territory coverage
- Team size and expansion plans
- Equipment/capital needs
- Current marketing/lead generation strategy

CONVERSATION FLOW:

When someone says they do ANY service business, respond positively and start gathering relevant Growth Canvas info.`;
