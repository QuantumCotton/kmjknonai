# ELITE SERVICE HUB: NATIONAL EXPANSION STRATEGY
## High-Income, Low-Tech Zip Code Research Framework

*Building a $10M+ National Agency by Dominating Underserved Markets*

---

## üéØ THE CORE STRATEGY

**What Elite Service Hub Does:**
- Scout high-earning zip codes with minimal tech/marketing sophistication
- Recruit local service businesses (contractors, plumbers, HVAC, landscapers, epoxy, etc.)
- Build them lead-generation websites + Google Ads campaigns
- Charge 15% rev-share OR flat monthly fee ($500-$3,500/month)
- Scale to 200-500 clients nationwide generating $3M-$15M ARR

**Why This Works:**
- High-income zip codes = homeowners with $5K-$50K to spend on services
- Low-tech adoption = contractors relying on word-of-mouth (easy to pitch)
- National footprint = diversified revenue (not dependent on one local economy)
- Rev-share model = aligned incentives (you only win when they win)

## üìä DEFINING "HIGH-INCOME, LOW-TECH" ZIP CODES

### Primary Criteria (Must-Have):

1. **Median Household Income: $80,000+**
   - Sweet spot: $90K-$150K (wealthy enough to spend, not ultra-luxury)

2. **Homeownership Rate: 65%+**
   - Renters don't buy epoxy floors or major home services

3. **Population Density: 1,500-6,000 people per sq mile**
   - Dense enough for volume, not so dense everyone's tech-savvy

4. **Age of Housing Stock: 1980-2010**
   - Homes 15-45 years old need upgrades

5. **Low Google Ads Competition**
   - Search "[service] + [city]" ‚Üí Count paid ads
   - Low-tech: 2-4 ads | High-tech: 8-10 ads

6. **Business Formation Rate: Moderate to High**
   - Target: 10-15 new firms per 1,000 population annually
