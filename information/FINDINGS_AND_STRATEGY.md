## üí∞ THE PROFITABILITY MATH (Week 1 @ $100 Spend)

### üèÜ **#1 WINNER: TV Mounting Port St Lucie**

**The Numbers:**
- **CPC:** $6.29 (lowest!)
- **Clicks:** 100 √∑ 6.29 = 15.9 clicks

- **Leads:** 15.9 √ó 0.10 = 1.59 leads
- **Close Rate:** 35% (high urgency)
- **Jobs Won:** 1.59 √ó 0.35 = **0.56 jobs**
- **Avg Sale:** $350
- **Your Commission:** $350 √ó 15% = $52.50
- **Revenue:** 0.56 √ó $52.50 = **$29.40**
- **Net Profit:** $29.40 - $100 = **-$70.60 LOSS** ‚ùå

**BUT** - This is the BEST option (loses least money)

### üò± **#15 WORST: Kitchen Remodel Stuart**

## ü§î THE PROBLEM: YOU CAN'T GET 3 JOBS FOR $100

### **Your Original Claim:**
"$100 = 3 handyman jobs = breakeven"

### **The Reality (Handyman Stuart @ $8 CPC):**
- **Clicks:** 100 √∑ 8 = 12.5 clicks
- **Leads:** 12.5 √ó 13.45% = 1.68 leads
- **Jobs:** 1.68 √ó 30% = **0.50 jobs** (not 3!)
- **Revenue:** 0.50 √ó $60 = **$30**
- **Loss:** -$70 per week ‚ùå

### **To Get 3 Jobs, You'd Need:**
- 3 jobs √∑ 30% close = 10 leads needed
- 10 leads √∑ 13.45% CVR = 74 clicks needed
- 74 clicks √ó $8 CPC = **$592/week required**

**Your entire $500 budget = less than 1 week of ads!**

## üî• THE BRUTAL TRUTH

### **NONE of these services are profitable at $100/week in Week 1**

Here's why:
1. **CPCs are too high** ($6-20 per click)
2. **Conversion rates are realistic** (2-13%, not magical 40%)
3. **Close rates are industry standard** (25-35%, not 100%)
4. **You need VOLUME** - but $100 doesn't buy enough clicks

### **The Math You NEED to Survive:**

**Option A: Lower Your Costs**
- Get CPC down to $2-3 (unlikely in Stuart)
- Improve CVR to 20%+ (world-class landing page)
- Close 50%+ of leads (elite sales skills)

**Option B: Increase Budget**
- Spend $300-500/week to get more volume
- Accept 2-3 weeks of losses
- Rely on cumulative results

**Option C: Different Business Model**
- Don't do ads at all
- Do SEO/organic (takes 6-12 months)
- Door-to-door / flyers / referrals
- Partner with existing contractor who has ad budget

## üéØ WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH $500?

### **Strategy 1: The Hail Mary (High Risk)**
**Week 1-5:** Spend entire $500 on TV Mounting or Handyman Jensen Beach
- Hope to get 3-5 jobs
- Each job = $50-60 commission
- Total revenue: $150-300
- **Net: -$200 to -$350 loss**
- **If it fails, you're done**

### **Strategy 2: The Slow Build (Low Risk)**
**Week 1-4:** Spend $100/week on lowest CPC service (TV Mounting)
- Expect 0-1 jobs per week
- Revenue: $0-50/week
- Losses: -$50 to -$100/week
- **Month 1 total: -$200 to -$400 loss**
- **Keep $100-300 in reserve**

### **Strategy 3: The Hybrid (Recommended)**
**Weeks 1-2:** Test TV Mounting @ $100/week
- If you get 1+ jobs, continue
- If zero jobs, STOP

**Weeks 3-4:** IF profitable, test Handyman Jensen Beach @ $100/week
- Compare results
- Double down on winner

**Week 5+:** IF you have any money left, scale the winner
- Increase to $150-200/week
- Should hit 1-2 jobs/week by Month 2

## üö® THE HONEST ANSWER

### **Can you bootstrap a lead-gen business with $500?**

**Probably not through Google Ads alone.**

Here's why:
1. **Ad costs are too high** for the commission you make
2. **$500 isn't enough volume** to overcome the randomness
3. **You need 30+ conversions** before Google optimizes your ads
4. **Payback periods** mean you're always waiting for money

### **What WOULD work:**

**A. Have more capital**
- $2,000-5,000 to properly test
- Absorb 2-3 months of losses
- Scale what works

**B. Do organic marketing**
- SEO (free but takes 6 months)
- Google Business Profile (free, works faster)
- Facebook groups / Nextdoor (free)
- Door hangers ($200 for 10,000 prints)

**C. Partner with contractors**
- They pay for ads
- You manage their campaigns
- 15% of revenue is your fee
- No upfront capital needed

**D. Freelance marketing first**
- Get paid $1,500-3,000/month to run someone else's ads
- Build your portfolio
- THEN use profits to fund your lead-gen business

## üéØ MY RECOMMENDATION

**Don't spend the $500 on Google Ads yet.**

Instead:
1. **Spend $200 on door hangers** (10,000 prints = $0.02 each)
2. **Target affluent neighborhoods** in Palm City
3. **Offer TV mounting + handyman** services
4. **Include a website with phone number**
5. **Track which services get calls**

**Why this works better:**
- $200 reaches 10,000 homes vs. 15-30 people online
- No competition (mailboxes are empty)
- Immediate visibility (they see it TODAY)
- You learn which services people want
- Use the other $300 to THEN fund ads for proven services

**Expected results:**
- 0.5-1% response rate = 50-100 calls
- 30% schedule quote = 15-30 leads
- 30% close = 5-9 jobs
- 5 jobs √ó $60 commission = **$300 revenue**
- ROI: $300 - $200 = **$100 profit**

**THEN** use that $400 ($300 revenue + $300 saved) to fund Google Ads with confidence.
