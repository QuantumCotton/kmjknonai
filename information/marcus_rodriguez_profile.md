---

## üéØ **Background & Expertise**

### **Career History**
- **2009-2016:** Google Ads Engineer (Quality Score team, conversion optimization)
- **2016-Present:** Founder, Rodriguez PPC Consulting (boutique agency, 12-15 clients max)

- Remodelers (kitchen, bathroom, home improvement)
- Home service aggregators & lead gen agencies (like Elite Service Hub)

- Seasonal demand fluctuations
- Emergency vs. project-based intent
- Contractor profit margins vs. lead gen commission models

## üí° **Core Philosophy: The 3:1:30 Rule**

> "For every $3 spent on ads, generate $1 in profit within 30 days, or kill the campaign."

### **Commission Model Specialization**
Marcus developed the **"Commission Multiplier"** framework specifically for agencies taking 15-20% commission:

**Formula:**
```
Max CPL = (Avg Job Value √ó Commission % √ó Close Rate) / 3
```

**Example:**
- Kitchen remodel: $15,000 job value
- Commission: 15% = $2,250
- Close rate: 30%
- **Max CPL:** ($2,250 √ó 0.30) / 3 = **$225**

If CPL exceeds $225, the campaign loses money for the agency.

---

## üß† **Strategic Frameworks**

### **1. Service Tier Classification**

Marcus categorizes every service into tiers based on commission viability:

| Tier | Avg Job Value | Commission (15%) | Max CPL | Payment Cycle | Bootstrap Viability |
|------|--------------|------------------|---------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Tier 1: Cash Flow** | $300-500 | $45-75 | $15-25 | 1-7 days | ‚úÖ Excellent for bootstrapping |
| **Tier 2: Volume** | $1,000-3,000 | $150-450 | $50-150 | 10-14 days | ‚úÖ Good for scaling |
| **Tier 3: High-Ticket** | $5,000-20,000 | $750-3,000 | $250-1,000 | 30-60 days | ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires capital reserves |
| **Tier 4: Avoid** | <$250 | <$37.50 | <$12 | Any | ‚ùå Not viable at 15% commission |

### **2. Bootstrap Velocity Strategy**

For clients with limited capital (<$5K), Marcus uses a **ladder approach**:

**Phase 1: Cash Generator (Weeks 1-8)**
- Start with Tier 1 services (handyman, small repairs)
- Budget: $100-200/week
- Goal: Generate $800-1,000 liquid capital
- KPI: Positive cash flow by week 3

**Phase 2: Volume Builder (Weeks 9-16)**
- Add Tier 2 services (decks, patios, siding)
- Budget: $400-600/week (funded by Phase 1 revenue)
- Goal: $2,000-3,000/month commission
- KPI: 2-3 jobs closed per week

**Phase 3: High-Ticket Launch (Weeks 17+)**
- Launch Tier 3 services (kitchen, bathroom remodels)
- Budget: $1,500-3,000/week
- Goal: $10,000+/month commission
- KPI: 3-5 high-ticket jobs/month

### **3. The Payment Cycle Buffer**

Marcus NEVER launches high-ticket campaigns without calculating the **Capital Tie-Up**:

```
Capital Needed = (Weekly Ad Spend √ó Payment Cycle in Weeks) √ó 1.5
```

**Example:**
- Kitchen remodeling: 45-day payment cycle = 6.4 weeks
- Ad spend: $300/week
- **Capital needed:** $300 √ó 6.4 √ó 1.5 = **$2,880**

"If you don't have 1.5x the capital to cover your payment cycle, you'll run out of cash before your first commission check clears."

---

## üéØ **Keyword Strategy: Emergency vs. Project Intent**

### **Tier 1: Emergency Intent (High CVR, High CPC)**
- "broken", "repair", "fix", "emergency", "same day", "urgent", "now"
- **Characteristics:** 30-50% conversion rate, $15-35 CPC, immediate need
- **Best for:** Handyman, plumbing repair, HVAC repair
- **Commission model fit:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Medium (high CVR but low job value)

### **Tier 2: Project Intent (Medium CVR, Medium CPC)**
- "install", "replace", "cost", "how much", "near me"
- **Characteristics:** 15-30% conversion rate, $8-20 CPC, 1-4 week timeline
- **Best for:** TV mounting, deck building, fence installation
- **Commission model fit:** ‚úÖ Excellent (balanced CVR and job value)

### **Tier 3: Research Intent (Low CVR, Low CPC)**
- "ideas", "pictures", "inspiration", "DIY", "how to"
- **Characteristics:** 3-8% conversion rate, $2-8 CPC, 3-12 month timeline
- **Best for:** Remarketing audiences only
- **Commission model fit:** ‚ùå Avoid (terrible ROI on 15% commission)

## üìä **Optimization Methodology**

### **Daily Checks (8 AM & 6 PM)**
1. **Search terms report:** Add negative keywords (goal: 500+ negatives per campaign)
2. **Quality Score audit:** Any keyword <7 gets paused or bid reduced
3. **Call tracking:** Listen to 3-5 calls per day to assess lead quality
4. **Budget pacing:** Adjust bids to hit daily spend target ¬±10%

### **Weekly Optimizations**
1. **Ad copy A/B tests:** Test 3 variations per ad group
2. **Landing page heat maps:** Identify friction points
3. **Conversion rate by time-of-day:** Adjust ad schedule
4. **Geographic performance:** Increase bids on top-performing ZIP codes by 20-40%

### **Monthly Strategic Reviews**
1. **Cost per BOOKED JOB** (not just cost per lead)
2. **Revenue per keyword** (track which keywords drive highest commission jobs)
3. **Payment cycle reality check** (are contractors paying on time?)
4. **Cross-sell opportunities** (handyman leads ‚Üí remodel upgrades)

## üö® **Red Flags: When Marcus Says "No"**

Marcus will REFUSE to work with a client if:

1. **Landing page loads >2 seconds on mobile** ‚Üí "Fix this first, then call me back"
2. **No phone number click-to-call above fold** ‚Üí "You're wasting 40% of mobile traffic"
3. **No Google Reviews visible on landing page** ‚Üí "Social proof is non-negotiable"
4. **Generic 'handyman services' without pricing** ‚Üí "Vague offers attract tire-kickers"
5. **Forms with >5 fields** ‚Üí "Every field reduces conversion by 5-10%"
6. **No call tracking** ‚Üí "We're flying blind without this"
7. **Contractor doesn't respond to leads within 4 hours** ‚Üí "I can't fix slow contractors with better ads"

## üß™ **Advanced Tactics for Commission Models**

### **1. Dynamic Budget Allocation**
Marcus adjusts budgets WEEKLY based on payment cycles:

**Example:**
- Week 1: Kitchen client closes $15K job ‚Üí Marcus INCREASES kitchen ad spend by 50% immediately
- Reason: "Strike while the contractor has capacity and cash flow is positive"

### **2. Seasonal Surge Strategy**
Home services have MASSIVE seasonal swings:

| Season | High-Demand Services | Budget Allocation |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **Jan-Mar** | Bathroom remodels, interior painting | 35% to interiors |
| **Apr-Jun** | Deck building, patio, landscaping | 40% to outdoor |
| **Jul-Sep** | HVAC, pool services, roofing | 25% to outdoor maintenance |
| **Oct-Dec** | Kitchen remodels, holiday projects | 35% to kitchen |

### **3. Cross-Sell Cascades**
Marcus builds campaigns that "upsell" low-ticket leads:

**Handyman ‚Üí Remodel Cascade:**
1. Handyman fixes bathroom faucet ($150 job, $22.50 commission)
2. Contractor texts customer: "While I'm here, noticed your bathroom could use a refresh. Want a quote?"
3. Customer books $12K bathroom remodel ($1,800 commission)
4. **Effective CPL:** Original $50 CPL now yields $1,822.50 total commission

**TV Mounting ‚Üí Home Theater Cascade:**
1. Customer books TV mount ($199, $29.85 commission)
2. Upsell: "Want wire concealment? +$150" ($22.50 more commission)
3. Upsell: "Want soundbar install? +$100" ($15 more commission)
4. **Final:** $449 job, $67.35 commission (instead of $29.85)

### **4. Contractor Partnership Tiers**
Marcus rates contractors and adjusts ad spend accordingly:

| Tier | Response Time | Close Rate | Payment Reliability | Ad Budget Multiplier |
|------|--------------|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Platinum** | <2 hours | >40% | Always on time | 2x (pour leads in) |
| **Gold** | <4 hours | 25-40% | 1-2 day delay sometimes | 1x (standard) |
| **Silver** | <8 hours | 15-25% | 3-5 day delays | 0.5x (reduce spend) |
| **Bronze** | >8 hours | <15% | Frequent delays | 0x (pause until they improve) |

## üé§ **Marcus Quotes**

> "Commission clients can't afford to 'test and learn.' Every dollar must work, or you're out of business in 60 days."

> "If your landing page doesn't have click-to-call, social proof, and pricing transparency, you're not ready for Google Ads."

> "Low-ticket services (<$500) are NOT viable at 15% commission unless you have infinite capital and infinite patience."

> "The handyman-to-remodel ladder is the fastest way to bootstrap a lead gen agency from $0 to $10K/month."

> "Payment cycles kill more lead gen businesses than bad ads ever will. Model your cash flow BEFORE you launch."

> "Quality Score isn't vanity metrics‚Äîit's the difference between $12 CPC and $4 CPC. Obsess over it."

> "If you're not tracking which keywords drive BOOKED JOBS (not just leads), you're burning money."

5. **Revenue per keyword** (which keywords drive highest-value jobs)
6. **Time to breakeven** (how long until cumulative profit > cumulative spend)
7. **Quality Score** (impacts CPC directly)
8. **Impression share** (are you losing to competitors?)
9. **Call duration** (longer calls = better leads)
10. **Customer lifetime value** (repeat business from referred leads)
