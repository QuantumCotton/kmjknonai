**Subject:** Partnership Opportunity: Pre-Qualified Kitchen & Bathroom Leads in Phoenix

Brian,

I came across your work on Skyline Group Construction, and I have to say‚Äîthe craftsmanship on that Vbathroom remodel is exceptional. The tile work, the glass enclosure, the attention to detail... it's exactly the caliber we look for when identifying partners in new markets.

**I'll get straight to the point.**

The Elite Service Hub is a performance-based lead generation firm that specializes in kitchen and bathroom renovations. We don't work with everyone‚Äîwe're selective about the contractors we partner with because our business model only succeeds when our partners deliver world-class work.

You fit the profile.

## What We Do (And Why This Works)

We generate **pre-qualified, ready-to-close leads** through high-performance Google Ads campaigns and convert them into signed contracts **before** handing them to you. No tire-kickers. No price shoppers. Just homeowners who are ready to move forward.

**Here's how we get paid:**

- **15% commission on the total project value** (that's it‚Äîsimple and transparent)
- **Payment #1:** At contract signing, you pay us a fixed advertising cost (typically $2,500-$3,000 depending on market)
- **Payment #2:** At job completion, you pay us the remaining commission balance

**The key:** You include our advertising cost in your "Materials + Labor + Advertising" line item when you bid the job. The customer never knows it's there‚Äîit's just part of your base cost. Then, you add your normal 30-40% markup on top.

**Your profit stays the same. Our cost becomes invisible.**

## Why This Model is Different

Most lead generation companies charge **per lead**‚Äîwhich means you pay whether you close the deal or not. That's a losing game.

We only make money **when you make money.** Our incentive is to send you high-quality, pre-qualified leads that close at 35%+ rates (industry average). If we send you junk, we don't get paid. Simple as that.

We've proven this model works. We're currently operating in Stuart, Florida, with a kitchen and bathroom contractor who's closing 2-4 jobs per month at an average ticket of $30K-$35K. The math works. The profit margins are strong. The leads are consistent.

Now we're ready to expand into **Phoenix.**

---

## What We're Looking For

We're not trying to flood the Phoenix market with 50 contractors. We want **one high-quality partner** who can handle 4-8 jobs per month in kitchens and bathrooms. Someone who:

- ‚úÖ **Delivers world-class craftsmanship** (your bathroom work speaks for itself)
- ‚úÖ **Communicates professionally** with customers (follow-up, timelines, expectations)
- ‚úÖ **Can scale capacity** (we'll ramp you from 2 jobs/month ‚Üí 8+ jobs/month over 6-12 months)
- ‚úÖ **Values partnership over transactions** (we're building something long-term here)

If that sounds like you, keep reading.

## The Numbers (Let's Do the Math)

**Example: $35,000 Bathroom Renovation**

**Your Bid to Customer:**
- Materials + Labor + Advertising: $25,000 (includes our $2,797 ad cost)
- + Your 40% Markup: $10,000
- = **Total Price to Customer: $35,000**

**What You Pay Us:**
- Check #1 (at signing): $2,797 (ad cost)
- Check #2 (at completion): $2,453 (commission balance)
- **Total: $5,250 (15% of $35,000)**

**Your Net Profit:**
- Gross Markup: $10,000
- Minus Our Commission Balance: $2,453
- **Your Net: $7,547 per job**

**At 4 Jobs Per Month:**
- **Your Monthly Profit: $30,188**
- **Your Annual Profit: $362,256**

And you didn't spend a dime on marketing. No Facebook ads. No Google Ads. No SEO. No lead aggregators. Just pre-qualified homeowners who are ready to sign.

## What Happens Next

If this sounds like something you'd want to explore, here's what I propose:

1. **Quick Call (20 minutes):** We walk through the model in detail, answer your questions, and see if there's a fit.
2. **Pilot Test (30 days):** We launch a small Google Ads campaign targeting Phoenix-area homeowners looking for kitchen/bathroom remodels. Goal: 2-4 signed contracts in the first month.
3. **Scale (Months 2-6):** If the pilot works (and it will), we ramp up to 8+ jobs/month and build predictable, recurring revenue for both of us.

**No long-term commitment. No upfront costs. You only pay us when you close a deal.**

---

## Why We're Reaching Out to You (And Not 100 Other Contractors)

We don't scale by working with everyone. We scale by working with the **best** in each market.

Your bathroom work is clean. Your finishes are sharp. Your attention to detail is obvious. That's the kind of partner we're looking for‚Äîsomeone who won't make us look bad when we send them a $40K bathroom remodel lead.

We're selective because our reputation depends on the quality of work our partners deliver. If you deliver exceptional results, we both win. If you don't, we both lose. It's that simple.

**So here's my question: Are you interested in dominating the Phoenix kitchen and bathroom market over the next 12 months?**

If the answer is yes, let's talk.

### Email Tone Analysis

**Positioning:** Exclusive, selective, high-value partnership (not a sales pitch)  
**Urgency:** Subtle scarcity ("one contractor per market", "moving on by Friday")  
**Social Proof:** References proven Florida model with real numbers  
**Transparency:** Full disclosure of commission structure and payment flow  
**Flattery:** Acknowledges his quality work, makes him feel selected  
**No-Brainer:** Clear math showing $30K+/month profit potential  

**Goal:** Make Brian feel like he'd be crazy to pass this up, and that we're doing HIM a favor by reaching out (not the other way around).
