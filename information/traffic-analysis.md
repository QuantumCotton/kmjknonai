# KMJK Traffic Diagnostic & Growth Plan

## Why traffic is likely stagnant
- **Limited search visibility.** The site shipped without a meta description, canonical tag, or structured data, making it harder for Google to understand the offer or rank pages for localized queries like “Stuart FL kitchen remodel.”
- **Generic messaging.** The hero copy, sections, and headings previously focused on broad promises that any contractor could claim. Prospects scanning the page could not tell what makes KMJK different or which specific homeowner profile you serve.
- **No authority signals on the homepage.** There was no quick proof of licensing, service area focus, or process rigor. Without signals of trust or specialization, visitors bounce or never click through ads.
- **Lack of funnel content.** Aside from portfolio photos, the site offers little educational or comparison content to capture mid-funnel searches (budgets, timelines, permitting in Martin County, etc.).

## Improvements shipped in this update
- Added locally targeted messaging, proof points, and qualification cues to the hero and homepage so high-value homeowners recognize the offer instantly.
- Implemented SEO essentials (meta description, Open Graph, Twitter cards, canonical URL, and JSON-LD local business schema) to increase click-through rate and eligibility for Google’s rich results.

## Next actions to build momentum
1. **Publish depth content every week.** Ship blog or landing page material covering local regulations, investment guides, and before/after stories optimized for Treasure Coast keywords. Repurpose the long-form research in `/information` into public posts.
2. **Activate local listings.** Ensure KMJK is verified on Google Business Profile, Houzz, Angi, and local Chamber sites. Add updated photos, service categories, and gather at least five detailed homeowner reviews.
3. **Create a nurture sequence.** Implement a lead magnet (e.g., “Treasure Coast Remodeling Budget Checklist”) with an email automation that educates prospects over 3–5 messages.
4. **Run remarketing ads.** With Google Analytics already installed, build remarketing audiences and launch lightweight Display + Meta campaigns that drive visitors back to the new qualification section.
5. **Track calls and forms.** Use call tracking or tagging so you know which channel each lead came from, then double down on the top-performing source.

Focus on the first two steps this week: fresh localized content and verified listings typically provide the fastest traffic lift for boutique service businesses.
