## 📊 WHY CONTRACTORS WILL ACCEPT THIS

### Traditional Model Problems:
- "You want 25% of my $10K kitchen job? That's $2,500!"
- Feels like you're taking their profit
- Hard to justify

### Your Model Advantages:
- "I spent $730 on ads (here's the proof), plus my $2,250 service fee"
- Transparent breakdown
- They can verify ad costs
- If you get MORE efficient, YOUR profit goes up (not theirs down)

### Contractor's Math:
```
Option A: They do it themselves
- Spend $730 on ads
- Close at 25-30% (need 3-4 leads)
- Actual ad cost: $1,000+
- Time spent on sales calls: 5+ hours
- Net: $13,270 profit, lots of headaches

Option B: You do it for them
- Pay you $2,980 ($730 + $2,250)
- Close rate: 40% (you're better)
- Time spent: 0 hours (you handle everything)
- Net: $12,020 profit, zero sales work

They make LESS profit but save TIME and HASSLE.
Many will take that trade.
