|------|----------|---------|-----------|-------|--------------|---------|----------|------------|--------------|-------|
| 10/4 | Handyman | [drywall repair stuart fl] | John Smith | 555-1234 | $400 | Yes | 10/6 | $60 | 10/6 | 3 tasks |

## 🎯 **WEEK 1 GOALS**

### **Primary Goal:**
- **Get 3-6 leads total** (any quality, just get data flowing)
- **Book 1-3 jobs** (prove the system works)
- **Break even or lose <$100** (expected to lose some Week 1)

### **Secondary Goal:**
- **Add 100+ negative keywords** (filter out junk traffic)
- **Identify top 3 performing keywords** (which ones drive actual jobs?)
- **Response time <1 hour** (train yourself to be fast)

### **What NOT to worry about:**
- ❌ Perfect CPL (too early to judge)
- ❌ Profitability (Week 1 losses are normal)
- ❌ Low conversion rate (need 30+ conversions for Google to learn)
- ❌ Comparing to competitors (focus on YOUR data)

---

## 🚨 **RED FLAGS (Pause Campaign If You See These)**

### **By End of Week 1:**
- **CPL >$80 for handyman** → Something's broken (landing page? targeting?)
- **CPL >$60 for TV mounting** → Too expensive, need to optimize
- **Zero leads after $100 spent** → Major problem, pause and troubleshoot
- **Leads but zero quote requests** → Landing page issue (call to action not working)

### **By End of Week 2:**
- **Close rate <10%** → Lead quality problem or quote follow-up issue
- **Avg job value <$300 for handyman** → Not hitting $375 minimum, need to reposition
- **Zero jobs booked after 10+ leads** → Sales process broken (response time? pricing? trust?)

---

## 📞 **LEAD RESPONSE PROTOCOL**

### **When Lead Comes In:**
1. **Respond within 1 hour** (ideally 15 minutes)
2. **If they texted photos:** "Got your photos! This looks like a [task]. We can handle this for [price range]. Our $375 minimum covers 2-3 tasks - anything else you need done while we're there?"
3. **If they called:** "Thanks for calling! Tell me about the project... [listen]... Great, we can do that. Our minimum is $375 which typically covers 2-3 tasks. What else have you been putting off?"
4. **Always bundle:** "While we're there, anything else? Small fixes we can knock out to maximize your $375 minimum?"
5. **Book on the spot:** "How's [tomorrow/day after] at [time]?"

### **Follow-Up Sequence (If They Don't Book Immediately):**
- **Hour 1:** Initial response (text or call back)
- **Hour 24:** "Hi [name], following up on your [project]. Still need this done? I have [day] at [time] available."
- **Hour 48:** "Hey [name], wanted to check in. If timing isn't right now, no worries - but I'm here when you're ready!"
- **Day 7:** Final follow-up: "Last check-in! If you still need [project] done, let me know. Otherwise I'll close out your file."
