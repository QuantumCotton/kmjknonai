Brian,

Your bathroom work in Phoenix is excellent—exactly the quality we're looking for.

**Here's the deal:** We work like a salesman earning 15% commission. We get you kitchen and bathroom jobs. You pay us **after** you get paid by the customer.

**How it works:**
1. We generate exclusive leads (not competitive, primed for your pricing)
2. When you close a job and receive your first check, you pay us our advertising reimbursement 
3. When you receive final payment, you pay us the remaining commission balance

**Example on a $55K kitchen:**
- Your net profit: **$10,261**
- Target: **2-4 jobs/month** = $20K-$41K monthly profit

**Why I guarantee quality:** I don't make a dollar unless you make money. These aren't shared leads—they're exclusively yours, and they're already expecting premium pricing.

We're doing this with our Florida contractor right now (2-4 jobs/month, $50K-$60K average). Phoenix is next. One contractor per Metropolitan Area only.

If you want to text me at **650-501-7659** this week. I'm moving forward with someone by Next week!

**P.S.** — One contractor per market. Once I partner with someone in Phoenix, this opportunity closes.
