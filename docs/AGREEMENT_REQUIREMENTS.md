# Contractual Requirements & "Air-Tight" Provisions

**Prepared By:** "The Contract Architect"
**Purpose:** To translate the operational model (Pooled Labor) into binding legal mechanics.

## 1. The "Labor Pool" Mechanism (The Core Risk)

This is the most unique part of the proposal and therefore the most legally fragile. It must be defined not as "hours" but as "Capacity Access."

* **"Use-It-or-Lose-It" Clause:**
  * Explicitly state that unused Weekly Pool Hours **expire at 11:59 PM on Sunday**.
  * **Prohibited:** Rollover credits, cash value redemption, or "banking" hours for future projects.
  * **Rationale:** Prevents an owner from paying for 3 months (quiet season) and then demanding 100 hours of labor in Week 13 for a renovation.

* **Definition of "Hour":**
  * **Clock Start:** Hours are billed portal-to-portal or upon arrival? (Recommend: "Upon arrival at the portfolio/site").
  * **Minimum Increments:** "All tasks billed in minimum 30-minute increments."
  * **Trip Charges:** Are supply runs included in the pool? (Recommend: "Yes, materials sourcing time counts against the pool").

* **Overage Mechanics:**
  * **Trigger:** Hours > 32 (Standard) or > 60 (Premium).
  * **Rate:** $78/hr (Standard) / $117/hr (After-hours).
  * **Notification:** KMJK must notify Owner when pool is 90% utilized? Or is it Owner's duty to track? (Recommend: "KMJK will notify when pool is exhausted; subsequent work pauses until Overage authorized").

## 2. Scope of Work: The "Maintenance vs. Renovation" Firewall

The proposal distinguishes between "Maintenance" (Included) and "Renovation" (Premium/Billable). This needs a hard definition to prevent "Standard" clients from demanding "Premium" outcomes.

* **Definition of "Minor Repair" (Included):**
  * "Repairs intended to restore functionality to an existing asset."
  * **Cap:** Any single task requiring > 4 hours of continuous labor is automatically classified as a "Project/Renovation" and requires separate scoping/hours (or Premium tier).
  * **Exclusions:** Flooring replacement (>1 room), full interior painting, cabinet replacement.

* **Definition of "Renovation" (Excluded from Standard/Budget):**
  * "Improvements intended to increase asset value or change aesthetics."
  * **Trigger:** Requires approval of scope and budget.

* **★ Premium Tier Exception ("Renovation Subscription"):**
  * **Authorized Use:** Premium Tier clients are *authorized* to use Pool Hours for Capital Improvements.
  * **Phase 1 (Stabilization):** Months 1-3 focus on critical repairs and learning the building. Renovations are "best effort" during this period.
  * **Phase 2 (Roadmap):** "Renovation Roadmap" agreed monthly. Unused maintenance hours shift to Roadmap projects (Variable Velocity).

## 3. Turnover Pricing Protection

"Standard Turn" ($1,200) is a flat rate. Flat rates are dangerous without boundary conditions.

* **"Standard Turn" Definition:**
  * Includes: Patching nail holes (up to 20), spot painting/touch-up (up to 20% of wall area), deep clean, safety check.
  * **Condition Precedent:** Unit must be "broom clean" and free of personal property.

* **"Heavy Turn" Triggers (Billable/Quoted):**
  * **Trash:** > 2 kitchen bags of debris left behind.
  * **Drywall:** Holes > 4 inches diameter.
  * **Paint:** Full wall color change or nicotine/smoke remediation required.
  * **Biohazard:** Pet waste, infestation, or hazardous materials (automatic exclusion from flat rate).

## 4. Emergency & Storm Waivers

The "Storm Prep Package" ($750) implies safety. We must clarify it only implies *effort*.

* **"Effort vs. Outcome" Waiver:**
  * "Owner acknowledges that Storm Prep Services constitute a *best-effort service* to secure the property. KMJK does not guarantee prevention of damage. KMJK is not an insurer."
* **"Priority Access" Clause:**
  * "Post-Storm Rapid Assessment is performed in order of portfolio tier: Premium First, then Standard, then Budget."

## 5. Material Markup & Spending Authority

* **"Emergency Mitigation" Authority:**
  * Grant KMJK authority to spend up to $X (e.g., $1,000) *without prior approval* strictly to stop active damage (active leaks, electrical fire hazards).
* **"Non-Emergency" Cap:**
  * Strict $250 limit for materials without written (text/email) approval.
* **Markup Definition:**
  * "Materials billed at Cost + 20%. 'Cost' includes item price + tax. Sourcing labor is deducted from the Labor Pool."

## 6. Liability for "Declined Services" (The Add-On Menu)

If they don't buy the add-ons, they own the specific risk.

* **HVAC Waiver:** "Owner declines 'HVAC Protection' ($35/unit). Owner accepts full liability for accelerated corrosion, coil failure, and drain line backups. KMJK is not responsible for consequential water damage from HVAC backups if 'No-Clog' program is declined."
* **Sewer Waiver:** "Owner declines 'Preventive Jetting'. Owner accepts liability for main line stoppages."

## 7. Anti-Gaming Provisions (The "Tier Switcher" Trap)

Prevent owners from jumping between tiers to abuse the system.

* **Minimum Term:** Tiers have a minimum 90-day lock-in? Or 30-day?
* **Downgrade Penalty / Re-inspection:**
  * "If Owner downgrades from Premium to Budget, a 'Condition Reset' inspection ($X) may be required before re-upgrading, to prevent using Premium hours to fix Budget-tier neglect."
* **Termination:** 30-day notice for cancellation.

## 8. Fee Structure (Internal vs. External)

* **"Administrative Platform Fee":**
  * The "Elite Service Hub fee" (6%) should be legally defined in the Master Service Agreement (MSA) as an administrative fee for the software/portal/management layer, ensuring it's distinct from the "Labor" revenue.

## 9. The "One-Page Close" Compatibility

* **Implementation Strategy:**
  * The **"Proposal"** (the HTML file) is the *Commercial Term Sheet*.
  * It references a **"Master Service Agreement (MSA)"** (Standard Terms & Conditions) hosted at a fixed URL (e.g., `kmjk.pro/terms`).
  * **Signature Block:** "By signing this Proposal, Owner agrees to the Standard Terms & Conditions located at [Link], including the 'Use-It-or-Lose-It' policy for labor hours."
