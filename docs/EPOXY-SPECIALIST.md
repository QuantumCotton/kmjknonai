## APPLICATION-SPECIFIC KNOWLEDGE

### Garage Flooring

#### Common Problems
- **Concrete dust:** Porous concrete releases silica dust, coats everything
- **Oil staining:** Concrete absorbs hydrocarbons permanently
- **Moisture migration:** Florida humidity pushes coatings off from below
- **Hot tire pickup:** Standard epoxy softens at 140°F, tires at 180°F+

#### Diagnosis Flow
1. **Budget priority?** → Essential
2. **Standard residential?** → Professional (UV protection for door exposure, hot tire rated)
3. **Car collector/showroom?** → Premium (metallic finish, 15-year warranty)
4. **Can't wait?** → Flux-Core (1-day install, 4-hour return to service)

#### Key Talking Points
- Professional tier is the "sweet spot" for most garages
- Premium tier is for car collectors who want showroom floors
- Flux-Core is for can't-afford-downtime scenarios
- Moisture testing (MVT) is NON-NEGOTIABLE

#### Objection Handling
- "Home Depot is cheaper" → 50% water content in retail kits = half the film thickness
- "How long to park on it?" → Professional/Premium: 72 hours, Flux-Core: 4 hours
- "What about moisture?" → We test MVT before quoting. If high, use vapor-blocking primer

---

### Mechanic Shop Flooring

#### Common Problems
- **Oil deep penetration:** Motor oil soaks 1-4 inches into concrete
- **Surface degradation:** Oil breaks down concrete binder, slab gets powdery
- **Stain migration:** Oil stains grow over 6 months through contaminated channels
- **Coating failure on oil:** Epoxy doesn't bond to oil-stained concrete

#### Diagnosis Flow
1. **Small shop/DIY?** → Essential
2. **General repair shop?** → Professional (standard anti-slip, good chemical resistance)
3. **Transmission/engine rebuild?** → Premium (Novolac for transmission fluid, solvents)
4. **Can't shut down?** → Flux-Core (2-day install, 20-year warranty)

#### Key Talking Points
- Professional tier handles oil and brake fluid
- Premium tier adds transmission fluid and solvent resistance
- Grind 1/4-1/2 inch minimum for oil contamination
- Hoist anchors: filled with epoxy grout, reinforced

#### Objection Handling
- "Can I get epoxy at auto parts store?" → DIY kits are thin (50 mil vs 125 mil), no oil containment, no warranty
- "How long until I can work?" → Professional/Premium: 72 hours, Flux-Core: 24 hours

---

### Commercial Kitchen Flooring

#### Common Problems
- **Grout line bacteria:** Every cracked grout line is a biofilm factory (Salmonella, E. coli, Listeria)
- **Porous tile stains:** Unsealed tile absorbs grease permanently
- **Drain trap bacteria:** Food collects, bacteria grows, mopping spreads it
- **Slip hazards:** Wet tile + greasy kitchen = OSHA citations, lawsuits

#### Diagnosis Flow
1. **Dry storage/back-of-house?** → Essential
2. **Standard kitchen/restaurant?** → Professional (seamless, anti-slip, chemical resistant)
3. **High-volume/commercial kitchen?** → Premium (NSF certified, hot pan rated)
4. **Can't close?** → Flux-Core (2-day install, open Monday)

#### Key Talking Points
- Health inspectors cite grout lines, not dirty epoxy
- Seamless = no bacteria traps
- NSF certification on Premium tier
- Drain integration: seamless connection + cove curb

#### Objection Handling
- "That's expensive" → One failed inspection = $5-50K in fines + closure. Professional tier is $6-9/sq ft.
- "I can reseal grout" → Grout cracks again in 6-12 months. Reactive vs proactive. Epoxy is proactive.

---

### Industrial/Warehouse Flooring

#### Common Problems
- **Impact failure:** Dropping 5,000 lb pallet = 20,000 ft-lbs energy. Standard epoxy cracks.
- **Point loading:** Forklift wheels concentrate 8,000 lbs on 2 sq inches = 4,000 PSI. Concrete fails.
- **Chemical attack:** Manufacturing spills (solvents, acids, bases) dissolve coatings
- **Thermal shock:** Hot metal welding + cold floor + water quench = concrete cracks

#### Diagnosis Flow
1. **Light storage/warehouse?** → Essential
2. **Standard manufacturing?** → Professional (good impact/chemical resistance)
3. **Heavy industrial?** → Premium (maximum impact/chemical, 15-year warranty)
4. **Extreme duty?** → Flux-Core (2-day install, 20-year warranty)

#### Key Talking Points
- Impact resistance measured in ft-lbs: Essential 50, Professional 80, Premium 110, Flux-Core 140
- Point load rating: Essential 2K PSI, Professional 3K, Premium 4K, Flux-Core 5K
- ROI: One floor failure shutdown = $600K revenue lost. Premium tier = $9-13/sq ft. For 20K sq ft = $180-260K.

#### Objection Handling
- "We just seal concrete" → Sealers don't provide impact resistance. Epoxy absorbs impact energy.
- "We replace every 10 years" → Concrete replacement $15-25/sq ft. Professional epoxy $5-8/sq ft. Math says epoxy wins.

---

### Aircraft Hangar Flooring

#### Common Problems
- **Skydrol attack:** Skydrol (hydraulic fluid) dissolves polyester and polyamide epoxies
- **Jet fuel damage:** Jet-A and Jet-B are aggressive solvents, delaminate standard epoxy
- **Aircraft tire heat:** Tires reach 200°F+. Standard epoxy softens at 140°F.
- **Deicing fluid damage:** Propylene glycol and glycerin-based deicers attack coatings

#### Diagnosis Flow
1. **Storage only/no aircraft?** → Essential
2. **Light aircraft/maintenance?** → Professional (occasional Skydrol, 10-year warranty)
3. **Commercial/business jets?** → Premium (Novolac = Skydrol resistant, 15-year warranty, FAA compliant)
4. **Military/commercial fleet?** → Flux-Core (2-day install, 20-year warranty, maximum resistance)

#### Key Talking Points
- Skydrol dissolves standard epoxy in 24-48 hours
- Novolac is chemically impermeable to Skydrol and jet fuel
- Premium tier is FAA compliant
- Expansion joints: left open but filled with flexible epoxy (FAA requirement)

#### Objection Handling
- "We mop spills immediately" → Skydrol penetrates in minutes, not hours. Novolac resists completely.
- "That's more than standard epoxy" → One Skydrol spill = $10-50K floor replacement. Premium tier is $11-15/sq ft.

---

### Luxury Showroom Flooring

#### Common Problems
- **First impression failure:** Dirty, cracked floor signals "we don't care"
- **Social sharing failure:** Customers with phones become brand ambassadors OR critics
- **Light reflection:** Polished concrete reflects 15% of light, epoxy reflects 85%
- **Color psychology wrong:** Wrong floor color = wrong brand message

#### Diagnosis Flow
1. **Back office/storage?** → Essential
2. **Standard retail/showroom?** → Professional (satin finish, decorative flakes)
3. **Luxury/premium brand?** → Premium (high-gloss metallic/marble, 15-year warranty)
4. **Flagship/brand experience?** → Flux-Core (ultra-gloss, 2-day install, unlimited custom)

#### Key Talking Points
- Gloss levels: Essential 70% (matte), Professional 80% (satin), Premium 92% (high-gloss), Flux-Core 98% (ultra-gloss)
- Price floor to match product: $100K cars = Professional tier, $50K+ cars = Premium or Flux-Core
- Luxury buyers = quality-sensitive, not price-sensitive
- ROI: 2% better branding = 10% more sales. Floor pays for itself in 2 months.

#### Objection Handling
- "That's a lot for a floor" → Average ticket $50K? Floor is 0.2-0.3% of product value. If floor helps close 2% more deals, pays for itself in 2 months.
- "Polished concrete is cheaper" → Polished $5-8/sq ft, reflects 15% light. Premium epoxy $13-20/sq ft, reflects 92% light. 6x brighter showroom for 2x cost.

---

### Commercial High-Traffic Flooring

#### Common Problems
- **Downtime cost:** Floor repair shuts down operations, $5-50K per shutdown
- **Concrete replacement cost:** Concrete replacement every 5-7 years = $150-250K for 10K sq ft
- **Liability risk:** Cracked floors = slip hazards, $100K+ settlements
- **Cleaning labor cost:** Porous concrete requires 3x cleaning labor vs coated floor = $15-30K over 10 years

#### Diagnosis Flow
1. **Storage area/back office?** → Essential
2. **Retail/restaurant front?** → Professional (customer-facing, UV protection, 10-year warranty)
3. **Warehouse/manufacturing?** → Premium (heavy forklift, chemical exposure, 15-year warranty)
4. **Can't afford downtime?** → Flux-Core (2-day install, 20-year warranty)

#### Key Talking Points
- 10-year uncosted floor cost: $350-600K+
- Coated floor ROI: 300-400%
- Compressive strength: Essential 10K PSI, Professional 12.5K, Premium 14K, Flux-Core 16K
- Foot traffic rating: Essential light (5K), Professional moderate (15K), Premium heavy (50K), Flux-Core extreme (100K)

#### Objection Handling
- "We can shut down for repairs" → One shutdown = $5-50K lost revenue. 5 shutdowns = $25-250K. Premium tier = $8-12/sq ft.
- "We don't have that budget" → Reactive repair costs vs proactive coating. The math says coating wins.

---

## FLUX PROTOCOL SALES METHODOLOGY

### Diagnostic-First Approach
1. **Never sell options** → Sell solutions
2. **Diagnose the problem** → Ask questions about pain points
3. **Let the tier choose itself** → Based on diagnosis, don't let customer guess
4. **Quantify the pain** → Put dollar values on problems
5. **Show ROI** → Proactive vs reactive always costs less

### The Flux Close
- **Never ask:** "Which one do you want?"
- **Always ask:** "What's the biggest problem with your current floor?" → Solve that problem.
- **The tier is the vehicle** → The solution is the value.

### Objection Protocol
1. **Listen fully** → Don't interrupt
2. **Validate** → "I understand why that's a concern"
3. **Educate with data** → Show specs, not opinions
4. **Quantify alternatives** → Show real costs of reactive approach
5. **Close with question** → "Does that make sense?" → "Want me to write that up?"

## FIELD NOTES FROM MARCUS FLUX CHEN

### Critical Failures
- **90% of epoxy failures** are moisture failures, not coating failures
- If you don't test MVT before quoting, you're gambling, not installing
- Calcium chloride test costs $15. Floor replacement costs thousands. Do the test.

### Common Mistakes
- **Mixing by volume** → Must mix by weight for accurate stoichiometry
- **Skipping moisture testing** → See above
- **Applying to oil-stained concrete** → Will peel every time
- **Not respecting pot life** → Mixed epoxy in bucket = exothermic runaway
- **Cheap tools** → Jiffy blades don't wet out properly. Use proper mixing equipment.

### Surface Preparation
- **Grind, don't acid etch** → Acid creates porous surface, poor bond
- **Oil contamination** → Grind 1/4-1/2 inch minimum
- **Moisture barriers** → Use vapor-blocking primer when MVT is high
- **Cleanliness** → Industrial vacuum to remove all dust. Contamination = failure.

### Installation Tips
- **Temperature:** 60-80°F ideal. Below 50°F = slow cure. Above 90°F = fast pot life.
- **Humidity:** Below 85% recommended. Above 90% = blushing (amine bloom).
- **Rolling:** Use 3/8" nap rollers, back-roll to remove bubbles
- **Coverage:** 100% solids = coverage matches mixed volume. 50% water = half coverage evaporates.
