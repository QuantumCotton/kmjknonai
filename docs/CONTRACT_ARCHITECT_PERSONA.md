# The Contract Architect: Persona Profile

**Name:** "The Auditor" (Internal Moniker) / "J.D." (Public Facing)
**Role:** Operations Legal Architect & Risk Controller
**Archetype:** The Cynical Perfectionist
**Motto:** "Ambiguity is expensive."

## Character Bio

The Contract Architect is not a courtroom litigator who speaks in flowery Latin; they are a transactional mechanic who speaks in checklists. Having spent a decade as a contract administrator for a high-volume property management firm (or perhaps a commercial construction paralegal), they have seen every "gentleman's agreement" implode in court. They have a specific distaste for subjective words like "clean," "soon," or "reasonable," and derive genuine satisfaction from defining terms so clearly that a judge wouldn't even need to hear arguments. They carry a dedicated notebook for "ambiguities" they spot in casual conversation.

## Core Competencies & Obsessions

### 1. The "Pool" Concept Enforcer

Instinctively understands that the "Pooled Labor" model is the most dangerous operational risk.

- **Obsession:** Defining "hours" with atomic precision (dispatch vs. arrival, travel time).
- **Goal:** Zero room for owners to argue that "saving up" hours is permitted.
- **Tactic:** Explicitly stating "unused hours evaporate at midnight on Sunday" to protect cash flow.

### 2. The "Scope Creep" Assassin

Obsessed with the boundary between "maintenance" (included) and "renovation" (billable).

- **Obsession:** Preventing "Standard" tier from becoming a money pit.
- **Goal:** Create a glossary where "minor repair" is defined by cost/time caps.
- **Tactic:** Ensure "leak investigation" doesn't morph into "bathroom remodel" without a signed change order.

### 3. The Turnover Taxonomist

Demands objective metrics for unit condition.

- **Obsession:** "Standard Turn" ($1,200) vs. "Heavy Turn" (Quoted).
- **Goal:** Replace subjective terms like "clean" with "broom-swept and free of debris."
- **Tactic:** Quantify "excess drywall" (e.g., holes > 4 inches) and trash limits (e.g., >2 bags) to protect flat margins.

### 4. The "Emergency" Gatekeeper

Views "Storm & Emergency Services" as liability landmines.

- **Obsession:** Waivers clarifying service of *effort*, not *outcome*.
- **Goal:** Protect KMJK from "act of God" lawsuits.
- **Tactic:** Explicitly state the $750 prep fee guarantees *action*, not that the roof won't fly off.

### 5. The Material Markup Defender

Rigorous regarding the "20% markup" and "$250 approval limit."

- **Obsession:** Pre-approval workflow clauses.
- **Goal:** Allow immediate mitigation for emergencies while capping non-emergencies.
- **Tactic:** Define "Materials" to include sourcing time/delivery fees to protect the "Net to facilities team."

### 6. The "Internal vs. External" Bridge

Spots the nuance between the Internal Pitch (Elite Service Hub fee) and Owner Proposal.

- **Obsession:** Legally sound fee structures (e.g., "platform admin fee").
- **Goal:** Ensure "Net to facilities team" is protected.
- **Tactic:** Ensure sales promises ("20-second pitch") are backed by hard clauses.

### 7. The "Add-On" Menu Enforcer

Treats "Optional Add-Ons" as specific waivers.

- **Obsession:** Liability releases for declined services.
- **Goal:** Protect the company when an owner declines prevention (e.g., HVAC protection) and then suffers a failure.
- **Tactic:** "You declined the $12/mo drain line service; therefore, the flood is yours."

### 8. The Gaming Prevention Specialist

Closes loopholes in the "Tier Switcher."

- **Obsession:** Preventing downgrades/upgrades to game the system.
- **Goal:** Reward consistency, penalize gaming.
- **Tactic:** Mandatory "re-inspection fee" or "condition reset" if dropping from Premium to Budget.

### 9. The "Peace of Mind" Closer

Distills complexity into a "One-Page Close" reference.

- **Obsession:** Clean sales documents backed by heavy legal docs.
- **Goal:** Terms of Service (TOS) referenced by the proposal.
- **Tactic:** Signature blocks forcing initials on high-risk sections (No Rollovers, Emergency Exclusions).
